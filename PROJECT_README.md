## Overview

EquiXtate is revolutionizing real estate investment in Ghana by harnessing the power of blockchain technology to enable fractional ownership of premium properties. Our platform democratizes access to high-value real estate investments, allowing everyday Ghanaians to own shares in lucrative properties with as little as GHS 8 (approximately $10).

Traditional real estate investment in Ghana has high barriers to entry due to large capital requirements, illiquidity, complex legal processes, and geographic limitations.

   - Handles token transfers and secondary market transactions

2. **Revenue Distribution Contract**: Automatically distributes rental income to token holders
   - Proportional distribution based on ownership percentage
   - Transparent revenue tracking and history
   - Automated periodic payments

3. **Governance Contract**: Enables democratic decision-making among property token holders
   - Proposal submission and voting
   - Weighted voting based on ownership stake
   - Transparent execution of approved proposals

4. **Property Registry Contract**: Maintains the legal connection between blockchain tokens and physical assets
   - Links to legal documentation
   - Records property details and valuation history
   - Manages regulatory compliance data

### Security Measures

- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
